Description: Provides support for transformations of numeric aggregates
   between statistical classifications (e.g. occupation or industry categorisations) using the Crossmaps framework. 
   Implements classes for representing transformations between a source and target classification
   as graph structures (i.e. Crossmaps), and methods for validating and applying crossmaps to transform
   data collected under the source classification into data indexed using the target classification codes.
